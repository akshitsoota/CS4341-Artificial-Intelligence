Compiling the project:
Our application was compiled by running the following:

Running the project:
To run the project, pass in the name and extension of the graph file to be read in. Our
project is expecting graph files to be stored in the folder where the source and compiled
project files are located. Additionally, our application accepts the absolute file path
wrapped in quotes.

Example:
If the graph file is located in the src/ folder, run "java Main graph.txt"

We have attempted the bonus problem for this project. Our graph is stored in the root folder
for the project in the file BonusProblem.txt.

Our project was run against graph.txt, second_graph.txt, and BonusProblem.txt. The output
from each of these tests is stored in output/ under the corresponding file names.
